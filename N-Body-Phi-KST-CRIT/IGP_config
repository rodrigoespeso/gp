// The method used by parallelism manager to decide when multithreaded application has to create a new thread.
// The following methods have been built, where the parallelism manager decides to create news threads,
// METHOD / APPROACH: NON ADAPTIVE METHOD
//   0    /    0    : if total number of active threads is less than MAX_THREADS.
// METHOD / APPROACH: ADAPTIVE METHODS AT APPLICATION LEVEL
//   1    /    0    : if the application performance with n threads measured by parallelism manager in last time between the
//                  : application performance with n-1 threads is better than a THRESHOLD chosen and total number of active
//                  : threads is less than MAX_THREADS. The THRESHOLD value is between 0 and 1.
//   2    /    0    : if last PERIOD between idle average time of all cpus in this interval time is higher than THRESHOLD
//                  : chosen and total number of active threads is less than MAX_THREADS. The idle time of cpus are reading
//                  : from /proc/stat file. The THRESHOLD value is between 0 and 100.
//   2    /    1    : if sleeping time of all threads in the last PERIOD is null and total number of active threads is less than
//                  : MAX_THREADS. The sleeping time of threads are reading form /proc/[id_pid]/task/[id_tid]/stat files.
//   2    /    2    : if Phi temperature less fan-in temperature doesn`t increase a THRESHOLD chosen and total number
//                  : of active threads is less than MAX_THREADS. The Phi and fan-in temperatures are reading from /sys/class/
//                  : micras/temp file. The THRESHOLD value is between 0 and 100.
//   2    /    3    : if Phi power running multithreaded application less phi power in idle state doesn’t increase a THRESHOLD
//                  : chosen and total number of active threads is less than MAX_THREADS. The Phi power is reading from /sys/
//                  : class/micras/temp file. The THRESHOLD value is between 0 and 100.
//   3    /    0    : if the application power is under a POWER THRESHOLD and the total_work hasn't decreased
//                  : The THRESHOLD value is between 0 and 1.
// METHOD / APPROACH: ADAPTIVE METHODS AT KERNEL LEVEL
// 3,4,5  /   0-5   : Kernel-level methods.
