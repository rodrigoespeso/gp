# gp
Due to the growth of the parallel architectures, also the multithreading
applications have been developed during the last years, so it was
needed tools which support the parallel programing in order to take
advantage of the potential of multiprocessors and multithreaded
processors. In this project, the "Gestor del nivel de Paralelismo " or "GP"
(paralelism level manager) is estudied at kernel level as a tool which
assist multithreaded applications to manage the number of threads in
execution and therefore, to develop its efficiency. In this project the GP is
integrated in the Linux kernel of the
Intel® Manycore Platform Software Stack (Intel® MPSS) installed
on the coprocessor Intel® Xeon Phi. Besides, the "Interfaz para el Gestor
de Paralelismo" or "IGP" library (paralelism manager interface)
was integrated into an existent application, in order to obtain a
benchmark through which tests have been executed on the coprocessor to
demonstrate the performance of the GP at kernel level.
